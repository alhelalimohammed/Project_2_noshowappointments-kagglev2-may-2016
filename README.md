# Introdation:
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
# Choose Your Data Set:
I chose the dataset of noshowappointments kagglev2 may 2016 and This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
#  Analyze Your Data:
I asked useful questions in my analysis of the appointment data and extracted some useful pointers from it. 
What is the distribution of gender?
What are the ages that are recorded by appointments?¶
What is the mean average no-show and attendance percentage?¶
# Conclusions
We concluded that the most common type recorded in dates is female. It was concluded from the age groups that the most recorded appointments are for children and the elderly after the age of fifty. I concluded that those who did not attend their appointments were three times more than those who attended their appointments
